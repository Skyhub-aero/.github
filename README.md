What is SkyHub? ✈️


SkyHub is a website that gives you the chance to be part of the airline industry. This industry is not easy get in, competitive and with a large shortage of jobs; that is where SkyHub flies in!







SkyHub facilitates the process of finding jobs in the area, by reuniting not only offers in the airline industry, but giving information about companies part of it as well. Think of Skyhub, as a hub for everybody that loves flying! If you are studying, for example, and want to know a bit more about salaries and perks for your future job, or if you are simply a worker in the area, our website is for you!



Not only we provide you the best information regarding the airline industry, but the most organized one; in the website we made a clear distinction between pilot, cabin and air traffic control crew jobs, so you can find offers that best suit you. The information about each airline is divided as well (by job type), so you can search directly and smoothly all the options available for you.



Skyhub’s website was built under tools like Next.js and TypeScript, using some extra packages like Tailwind or StoryBook. The goal was to mantain a clean and fresh code, up to today standards.



Sound interesting? Let's take a flight together then!
